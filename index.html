         <h3> Dublin, Ireland</h3>
         <p>Now you're probably thinking that I don't like Dublin Ireland either, you're wrong!
            Dublin is a place I really enjoyed visiting, it was just not as cool as the other places in my opinion.
            This was the first stop of our honeymoon so of course we were jet lagged from the 9 hour flight we had just taken.
            That did not stop us from immediately showering and going out and sightseeing.  Like Paris, Dublin was full of rich
            architecture and culture.  One of the main things surrounding Irish culture is their alcohol; so that's why we made sure 
            to get in a night of drinking and visit the Jameson distillery.  While those activities are fun, we really enjoyed being able to 
            hop of the public transit and take a one hour train ride to the gorgeous coast of Howth: a seaside village with absolutely beautiful scenery.
            We didn't mind that we had almost walked 8 miles that day, the views were worth it.  Dublin was a great first stop of our European tour;
            the people were friendly, the food was good, the views were amazing, and the country itself was gorgeous.  Like I said before, Dublin wasn't a 
            bad place to visit in the slightest, I think we just had a better time in the other cities.

         <h3> London, England</h3>
         <p>
            It was hard to put London as number 3 on my list. After getting our lodging cancelled on us as we got off the subway from the airport
            it made the decision a little easier. We were hopeful that stop number 2 on our trip would turn out to be a dud.
            I've always loved different things about the English culture; the food, the music, and a lot of
            different TV shows.  We spent our days biking throughout downtown London, exploring on foot and making our way to 
            Primrose hill, visiting the famous Abbey Road cross-walk, and eating the #1 rated fish n' chips in London.
            We also got to go to the famous ABQ bar in London: a bar built inside an RV based on the famous TV show Breaking Bad.
            Overall, we had an amazing time in London. After figuring out our lodging and getting used to the public transit, we througholy enjoyed our
            stay and are looking forward to going back.

         <h3> Amsterdam, The Netherlands</h3>
         <p>
            After being violently hungover from our ferry ride from England, we arrived in Amsterdam.
            I remember being so incredibly relaxed when we got to Amsterdam for many different reasons.
            Bikes are absolutely everywhere, which I thought would cause a lot of problems on the road; it didn't.
            I don't remember anyone getting angry or even a car horn going off.  Everyone's energy and vibe around the entire city
            was fantastic, I don't think I had a single negative interaction with anyone from Amsterdam.
            Obviously, we visited Amsterdam to see the Red Light District and partake in their legal cannabis, but that wasn't the only
            thing we liked about Amsterdam.  Everyday there weren't a bunch of city noises waking us up.
            We would wake up refreshed and ready to go sight-seeing.  I remember stopping and smelling flowers, and they smelled like some sort 
            of fruit candy; it seemed like this place was too good to be true.  After walking the equivalent to a marathon in London and Dublin,
            Amsterdam was an amazing place to rest and recharge for the rest of our trip.

         <a name="paris"></a>
         <h3>Paris, France</h3>
         <p>I'm sure you're wondering why I was not a fan of Paris.  "Jason, it's one of the most romantice cities."  "Jason, they have such a beautiful fashion and cuisine."
            I will absolutely agree with anyone that the food is phenomenal and the clothing is top notch.  There are a few other things that I personally did not like about Paris.
            For one, the cost of staying in Paris is quite steep compared to most of the other countries and cities that we visited.  Due to the high cost of our Airbnb we spent much time
            at the McDonalds and grocery store down the street.  We did splurge on a nice night out and indulged on some escargot and fancy cheese (both of which were amazing).
            Which brings me to my next point about why I disliked Paris the most, the people. We met two French men when we were out enjoying our garlicky snails; and they were out with two women from Germany.
            They asked why we were visiting Paris, so we told them about our honeymoon which prompted them to order us some drinks and spend some time with them. 
            The two women from Germany were wonderful (I remember one being named Vader), but the two men from France were two
            of the most racist, sexist, homophobic, people I've met in my whole life.  They spent most of the night throwing up the Nazi salute and disrespecting the two women that we were also with that night.
            we had a short experience with the two men from France, but if most of them are like that I do not wish to go back anytime soon.
            With this being one of the last stops on our honeymoon, we were hoping that it would be better. The rest of our time in Paris was spent sight-seeing at the Lourve and around the city itself.  There is a lot of beautiful architecture and scenery, but all the trash smell and rude people have definitely
            swayed me to never visit this "beautiful" city again.

         <h3>Barcelona, Spain</h3>
         <p>
           To say that I aboslutely loved Barcelona would be an understatement.
           Other than having difficulty finding our Airbnb location, we had an absolute blast.
           We found out early on that motor scooters are the best way to get around, so I rented one immediately.
           After we got our scooter, we were able to see so much of Barcelona and really take in the entirety of the city.
           I think we both especially enjoyed being able to ride our scooter and find all of the Gaudi architecture throughout the city. 
           We spent most of our time just sight-seeing and enjoying the rest of our honeymoon on the beach drinking sangria.
           I also love skateboarding, which is a popular sport in Barcelona, so my wife booked a class where we got to make our own skateboards.
           From riding our scooter around the city, to watching people absolutely shred at the local skateparks, I can speak for both of us when I say that it was an amazing time.
           It was hard for us to go home after we enjoyed ourselves so much, I myself cannot wait to go back.
